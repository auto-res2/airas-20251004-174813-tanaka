Typically, preference optimiza- tion is approached as an offline supervised learning task using manually crafted convex loss functions. While these methods are based on theoretical insights, they are inherently constrained by human creativity, so the large search space of possible loss functions remains under-explored. We address this by performing LLM-driven objective discovery to automatically discover new state-of-the-art pref- erence optimization algorithms without (expert) human intervention. Specifically, we iteratively prompt an LLM to propose and implement new preference opti- mization loss functions based on previously evaluated performance metrics. This process leads to the discovery of previously unknown and performant preference optimization algorithms. The best performing of these we call Discovered Prefer- ence Optimization (DiscoPOP)1, a novel algorithm that adaptively blends logistic and exponential losses. Experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of DiscoPOP and its successful transfer to held-out tasks. 1 Introduction Training Large Language Models (LLMs) usually involves starting with a model pre-trained on large text corpora and then fine-tuning it to match human preferences. Pre-trained, and even instruction fine-tuned LLMs, can generate harmful, dangerous, and unethical completions [Carlini et al., 2021, Gehman et al., 2020]. To mitigate this and align an LLM with human values, we use human preference alignment through preference-ranked completion data. This approach has become an industry standard, popularized by reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) [Christiano et al., 2017, RLHF], and more recently, by offline preference optimization algorithms like direct preference optimization [Rafailov et al., 2023, DPO] and sequence likelihood calibration [Zhao ∗Equal Contribution. †Work partially done at Spotify. ‡Equal Advising. 1Code: https://github.com/luchris429/DiscoPOP. 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024). arXiv:2406.08414v3  [cs.LG]  2 Nov 2024Foundation Model Proposal Extend/UpdateContext & Fitness Inner Loop Optimization Run CODE-LEVEL JSON FOUNDATION MODEL PROPOSAL:{\"thought\": \"Based on the previous outputs,...\",\"name\": \"cross_entropy_loss\",\"code\": \"def loss_fn(logits: torch.FloatTensor,targets: torch.FloatTensor) -> torch.FloatTensor:loss = F.cross_entropy(logits, targets)return loss\"} SYSTEM PROMPT: You are a machine learning researcher who is testing out different loss functions. <PROBLEM DESCRIPTION>.When you respond, output a JSON where the first key (\"thought\") corresponds to your thought process when designing the next function.

Conceptual illustration of LLM-driven discovery of objective functions. We prompt an LLM to output new code-level implementations of offline preference optimization losses E(yw,yl,x)∼D [f (βρ)] as a function of the policy ( πθ) and reference model’s ( πref) likelihoods of the chosen ( yw) and rejected ( yl) completions. Afterwards, we run an inner loop training procedure and evaluate the resulting model on MT-Bench. The corresponding performance is fed back to the language model, and we query it for the next candidate. Right. Performance of discovered objective functions on Alpaca Eval. et al., 2023, SLiC], which cast the problem as a supervised learning objective. Many algorithms have been proposed in the literature for offline preference optimization, and it remains an open question which one performs best across tasks. While a strictly dominant algorithm may not exist, some algorithms likely exhibit generally improved performance. To date, all existing state-of-the- art preference optimization algorithms [Rafailov et al., 2023, Azar et al., 2023, Zhao et al., 2023] have been developed by human experts. Despite their advancements, these solutions are inherently constrained by human limitations, including creativity, ingenuity, and expert knowledge. In this work, we aim to address these limitations by performing LLM-driven discovery to automati- cally generate new state-of-the-art preference optimization algorithms without continual expert human intervention in the development process. While previous works [Ma et al., 2023, Yu et al., 2023] have used LLMs to design environment-specific RL reward functions, we discover general-purpose objective functions which can be used across various preference optimization tasks. More specifically, we iteratively prompt an LLM to propose new preference optimization loss functions and evaluate them, with the previously proposed loss functions and their task performance metric (in our case, MT-Bench scores [Zheng et al., 2024]) as in-context examples. After performing this automatic discovery process, we catalogue high-performing loss functions and introduce a particularly strong one we call Discovered Preference Optimization (DiscoPOP), a new algorithm. To ensure robustness beyond MT-Bench, we validate DiscoPOP using AlapacaEval 2.0 [Dubois et al., 2024], showing an improvement in win rates against GPT-4 from DPO (11.23% → 13.21%). Additionally, in separate, held-out, tasks such as summarization and controlled generation, models trained with the DiscoPOP loss outperform or perform competitively with existing preference optimization algorithms. Contributions: 1⃝ We propose an LLM-driven objective discovery pipeline to discover novel offline preference optimization algorithms (Section 3). 2⃝We discover multiple high-performing preference optimization losses. One such loss, which we call Discovered Preference Optimization (DiscoPOP), achieves strong performance across multiple held-out evaluation tasks of multi-turn dialogue (AlpacaEval 2.0), controlled sentiment generation (IMDb) and summarization (TL;DR) tasks. 3⃝ We provide an initial analysis of DiscoPOP, which is a weighted sum of logistic and exponential losses, and discover surprising features. For example, DiscoPOP is non-convex. 2 Background Preference Optimization. Consider a pre-trained language model policy πθ and a dataset D = {(xi, yi w, yi l)}N i=1 consisting of prompts x and preference-ranked completions yw and yl. In this dataset, a human rater prefers yw over yl, denoted as yw ≻ yl. The task is to align πθ with the human values implicit in these preferences. Canonically, this has been achieved through reinforcement learning from human feedback [Christiano et al., 2017, RLHF], an approach that proceeds in two 2phases: First, a reward modelling stage that learns a parameterized reward model rϕ. By assuming a Bradley-Terry model [Bradley and Terry, 1952] of preferences, the probability of the data can be expressed as P(yw ≻ yl) = exprϕ(yw, x)/(exp rϕ(yw, x) + exprϕ(yl, x)), and subsequently simply optimized over ϕ through the maximum likelihood principle. The second stage of policy optimization employs a reinforcement learning algorithm to train the language model against the learned reward. Usually, a KL penalty is introduced between the model and the pre-RL reference policy πref [Jaques et al., 2019, Stiennon et al., 2020] to prevent over-optimization and straying too far from the original policy, resulting in the final objective: max πθ Ey∼πθ,x∼P [rϕ(y, x)]| {z } reward maximization −β KL(πθ, πref)| {z } regularization . (1) Despite success in frontier models [Anthropic, 2023, Gemini-Team, 2023], deep RL has many implementations [Engstrom et al., 2019] and training challenges [Sutton, 1984, Razin et al., 2023] that hinder its adoption. To simplify the whole process, direct preference optimization[Rafailov et al., 2023, DPO] aims to forego both the reward modelling and online RL procedure. Rewriting (1) with a decomposition of the KL term into: max πθ Ey∼πθ,x∼P h rϕ(y, x)| {z } reward + β log πref (y|x)| {z } πref regularization i + βH(πθ)| {z } policy entropy , (2) expresses the problem as an entropy-regularised RL bandit task [Ziebart et al., 2008], for which a known analytical solution exists: π∗(y|x) =Z(x)−1πref (y|x) exp \u0000 β−1rϕ(y, x) \u0001 . By rearranging the reward, we can express the task as a binary classification problem based on the reward difference: min πθ E(yw,yl,x)∼D \" f   β · \u0012 log πθ(yw|x) πref(yw|x) − log πθ(yl|x) πref(yl|x) \u0013 | {z } rϕ(yw,x)−rϕ(yl,x) !# . (3) Here, we define the log ratio difference as ρ = log πθ(yw|x) πref(yw|x) − log πθ(yl|x) πref(yl|x) . In DPO, the function f = −log σ is derived as the negative log of the sigmoid function given the BT model assumptions. However, Tang et al. [2024] highlighted that more generally we can obtain a recipe for offline preference optimization algorithms by letting f : R → R be any scalar loss function. For example, setting f(x) = (x − 1)2, the squared loss function [Rosasco et al., 2004] yields IPO [Azar et al., 2023], while employing the max-margin inspired hinge loss [Boser et al., 1992, Cortes and Vapnik, 1995] f(x) = max(0, 1 − x) produces SLiC [Zhao et al., 2023]. Meta-Optimization for Algorithm Discovery . The goal of meta-optimization (optimizing the optimization process) is to uncover novel learning algorithms using a data-driven process. Suppose that an algorithm uses an objective function fγ to train a model for K iterations, where γ denotes a set of meta-parameters. Meta-optimization searches for an objective that maximizes the expected downstream performance maxγ E[η(πK)|train(fγ)] where η is a downstream performance metric. Unlike previous methods that rely on a predefined parameterization of γ (e.g., a neural network [Hospedales et al., 2021] or domain-specific language [Alet et al., 2020]), we leverage LLMs to directly propose code-level objective functions in Python. This approach eliminates the need for a carefully designed search space and utilizes the extensive knowledge embedded in the LLM for flexible selection and mutation. 3 LLM-Driven Objective Discovery Choosing an appropriate objective function is crucial for instilling capabilities into networks. Here, we detail our discovery process facilitated by LLM code-level objective function proposals: Initial Context Construction. In the initial system prompt, we ‘burn-in’ the LLM using several established objective functions given in code and their corresponding performance. Furthermore, we provide problem details and an example of the output response format as a JSON dictionary. LLM Querying, Parsing & Output Validation. We query the LLM, parse the response JSON, and run a set of unit tests (e.g. for valid output shapes) before starting a training run. If the parsing or unit tests fail, we resample a new solution after providing the error message as feedback to the LLM. 3Performance Evaluation. The proposed objective function is then evaluated based on its ability to optimize a model for a predefined downstream validation task. We refer to the resulting performance metric as η. Iterative Refinement. By using the performance provided as feedback, the LLM iteratively refines its proposals. In each iteration, the model synthesizes a new candidate loss function, exploring both variations of previously successful formulas and entirely new formulations that might improve upon the existing benchmarks. This iterative process is repeated for a specified number of generations or until convergence when a set of optimal loss functions is observed. We summarise this general objective discovery process in Figure 1 and is shown in Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1 LLM-Driven Objective Discovery 1: Initialize LLM with established loss functions and their performance in context. 2: repeat for each generation i 3: LLM proposes a new candidate objective function fi 4: Run unit tests to check the validity of the candidate and resample if needed. 5: Evaluate the objective function using the performance metric η 6: Update the LLM context with the performance data 7: LLM refines generation strategy based on the feedback 8: until convergence criteria are met or maximum generations are reached Small case study: Discovering supervised classification loss functions . Consider the case of supervised classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset as a simple starting example. We train a simple ResNet-18 for 5 epochs using the objectives proposed by GPT-4 [OpenAI, 2023]. After each training run we provide the LLM with the corresponding validation accuracy and query it for the next PyTorch-based [Paszke et al., 2017] candidate objective function. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30LLM Proposals/Generations 65 70 75 80Best Accuracy LLM Objective Discovery - CIFAR-10 ValTest ResNet18SimpleDLAEfﬁcientNetB0 85 90 95Test Accuracy Cross-Entropy FT - Temp.

Left. Performance across LLM- discovery trials. The proposals alternate between exploring new objective concepts, tuning the components, and combining previous insights. Right. The best three discovered objectives transfer to different network architectures and longer training runs (100 epochs). Figure 2 depicts the performance of the proposed objective functions across the discovery process. The different discovered objectives all outperform the standard cross-entropy loss. Interestingly, we observe that the LLM-driven discovery alternates between several different exploration, fine-tuning, and knowledge composition steps: Initially, the LLM proposes a label-smoothed cross-entropy objective. After tuning the smoothing temperature, it explores a squared error loss variant, which improved the observed validation performance. Next, the two conceptually different objectives are combined, leading to another significant performance improvement. Hence, the LLM discovery process does not perform a random search over objectives previously outlined in the literature but instead composes various concepts in a complementary fashion. Furthermore, the discovered objectives also generalize to different architectures and longer training runs. In Appendix D.3 we show that this process of discovery is robust to the choice of sampling temperature and prompt/context construction. 4 Discovering Offline Preference Optimization Objectives In this section, we run our LLM-driven discovery to automatically generate new state-of-the-art preference optimization algorithms. 44.1 Discovery Task - Multi-turn Dialogue on MT-Bench 0 2 4 6 8 10 12LLM Proposals/Generations 7.7 7.8 7.9 8.0Best MT -Bench Scorelogistic margin losscombined logistic hinge loss scaled combined logistic hinge losstemperature scaled logistic lossdecaying weights logistic loss performance adaptive decay logistic lossLLM Objective Discovery - Preference Optimization 0.02.5 5.0 7.5 10.012.515.017.5LLM Proposals/Generations7.6 7.7 7.8 7.9 8.0Best MT -Bench Scoresmoothed hinge loss exponential log loss combined exp logistic loss adaptive quantile lossLLM Objective Discovery - Preference Optimization Figure 3: Examples of LLM Objective Discovery improvement across generations. The first and second runs are shown left and right respectively. In this section we use our LLM-driven discovery method to discover new objective func- tions f for offline preference optimization, as defined in Section 2 and Equation (3). Specif- ically, at each generation i, GPT-4 generates PyTorch [Paszke et al., 2017] code of can- didate objective function fi. Each objective function takes as input the variables of {log πθ(yw|x), log πref(yw|x), log πθ(yl|x), log πref(yl|x)}, and returns a scalar. For each proposed objective fi, we check if fi is valid with a unit test. For each valid generated objective function fi, we finetune an LLM and then collect a performance evaluation score. Specifically, we build on top of the ‘alignment-handbook’ [Tunstall et al., 2023a] repository to finetune our models. Notably, this repository, when using DPO, reproduces ‘Zephyr 7B Gemma’2 Tunstall and Schmid [2024], Tunstall et al. [2023b], which at the time of release, achieved state-of-the-art scores on MT-Bench for 7B models. ‘Zephyr 7B Gemma’ first takes gemma-7b [Gemma-Team et al., 2024] and finetunes it on the ‘deita-10k-v0-sft’ dataset [Liu et al., 2023] to produce ‘zephyr-7b-gemma-sft’3. It is then trained on the pairwise preference dataset of ‘Argilla DPO Mix 7K’4. When evaluating a new objective function, we replace DPO in this last step with the generated objective function, keeping the same hyperparameters. We show example runs in Figure 12 and provide further experimental details in Appendix B.

This is a multi-turn open-ended question set, which uses GPT-4 to assess the quality of the trained model’s responses, obtaining a high correlation with the popular Chatbot Arena [Zheng et al., 2024]. We provide further evaluation details in Appendix C. 4.2 Discovery Results After evaluating approximately 100 objective functions, we catalogued the best-performing ones in Table 1. We tabulate the high-level objective forms here and provide the full objective loss functions and their associated code in Appendix E. Moreover, we also plot the best performing sub-task evaluations in Figure 4. Table 1: Discovery Task MT-Bench Evaluation Scores for each discovered objective functionf.

We find that the Performance Adaptive Decay Loss (PADLL) and the Log Ratio Modulated Loss (LRML) consistently perform well. Because of its unconventional properties and performance, we refer to LRML as our discovered preference optimization, or DiscoPOP, algorithm. We consider three different standard [Rafailov et al., 2023] open-ended text generation tasks each designed to evaluate different properties of the fine-tuned LLM policy πθ where each LLM policy is trained with one of our discovered objective functions f on a preference dataset D = {(xi, yi w, yi l)}N i=1. 5.1 Single-turn Dialogue - Alpaca Eval 2.0 We evaluate the trained models on Alpaca Eval 2.0, [Li et al., 2023, Dubois et al., 2023, 2024]. This is a single-turn dialogue LLM-based automatic evaluation using GPT-4 to assess the win rate of the trained LLM policy’s completion compared to the of the underlying SFT base model. Alpaca Eval 2.05, has been validated against 20K human annotations, and aims to reduce the length bias of Alpaca Eval 1.0; where using length controlled (LC) Alpaca Eval shows a correlation with Chatbot Area of 0.98, making it a popular benchmark with the highest correlation to Chatbot Arena [Dubois et al., 2024]. We also detail task training details in Appendix B.1. Table 2: Alpaca Eval 2.0 - Held Out Single Turn Dialogue Task . Win rate of the discovered objective functions f evaluated on the Alpaca Eval 2.0 task against either GPT-4 or the SFT base model. Some of the discovered objective functions outperform the baselines, with the best bolded. We detail evaluation and error bars in Appendix C. We have highlighted the best scores with overlapping the standard errors.

As reference policies, we used GPT-4 for absolute comparison and the SFT-trained model for relative comparison. We observe that the discovered LRML (DiscoPOP), PADLL, and AQFL functions outperform the baselines and other discovered losses on the normal and length-controlled win rates. The differences in scores among these top- performing losses are not significant, except for the LC win rate against the SFT reference model, where DiscoPOP performs best. 5.2 Summarization (TL;DR) We train an LLM policy to, given a forum post on Reddit x, generate a summarization y of the main points. We finetune ‘zephyr-7b-gemma-sft‘ using 10% of the Reddit TL;DR summarization preference dataset [Völske et al., 2017] on each of the baseline and discovered objective functions. As a reference model, we again use ‘zephyr-7b-gemma-sft’. Further details on the training pipeline are outlined in Appendix B.2. To evaluate the quality of the summaries, we make use of the Alpaca Eval 2.0 library with a custom evaluation dataset existing of 694 test samples from the TL;DR dataset and a custom GPT-4 annotator template as described in Rafailov et al. [2023]. For additional details regarding the summarization evaluation see Appendix C.3. 5https://github.com/tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval 6In Table 3 the PADLL loss and DPO loss perform best, with little difference from each other, on the summarization task in three out of four metrics. Additionally, the LRML - DiscoPOP function achieves scores slightly below the top performers, especially in the length-controlled win rates. In contrast to the single-turn dialogue task, the AQFL loss does not achieve high scores in the held-out evaluation. Table 3: TL;DR - Held Out Summarization Task Win-rate of various preference optimization functions in the summarization task was evaluated with the Alpaca Eval 2.0 calculations, against a subset of the test set (694 samples). The baseline outputs are the human-generated preferences, and the model after SFT (see Appendix C for details). Note that the standard error in the LC win-rate has been rounded down because of values < 0.001. We have highlighted the scores with means overlapping the standard error of the best score.

We start with a GPT-2 [Radford et al., 2019] model, which had supervised fine-tuning on the IMDb dataset, and we perform preference optimization using the baseline and discovered objective loss functions. Details of the training implementations can be found in Appendix B.3. Inspired by Rafailov et al. [2023]’s experiments, we calculate the model rewards through a pre-trained sentiment classifier, which we use as a proxy for ground truth, as well as the KL-Divergence of the trained model and the reference model. Appendix C.4 provides further details into the evaluation for this task. We provide results of models with converging β values in Figure 5 for LRML compared against DPO and SLiC, displaying the model rewards against the KL-Divergence to the reference model. In Figure 5a, the LRML-trained text generator outperforms the DPO model in terms of rewards and KL-divergence with low β values (0.025, 0.05, 0.1). At higher β values (0.5 and 1.0) both methods show trends of increased KL-Divergence and lower rewards, but generally, LRML maintains a higher reward than DPO. In Figure 5b, we note that LRML slightly outperforms DPO, SLiC, AQFL, and PADLL atβ ∈ {0.05, 0.1} in terms of reward. For largerβ values (0.5 and 1.0), LRML shows similar trends of increased KL-Divergence and rewards like the other objective functions. A more detailed comparison between the individual discovered losses and the baselines can be found in Appendix Figure 8. 6 Analysis of DiscoPOP We list all our discovered objectives in Table 1, as well as the code and mathematical representations in Appendix E. In this section, we now analyze the Log Ratio Modulated Loss, which we define as the DiscoPOP loss function, as it performs consistently high across the held-out evaluation tasks, and we provide some intuitive understanding of how it outperforms the existing state-of-the-art objectives. 6.1 Log Ratio Modulated Loss (DiscoPOP) The Log Ratio Modulated Loss is a dynamically weighted sum of the logistic loss (as used in DPO) and the exponential loss. The weight of each is determined through a sigmoid calculation of the 70.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 KL Divergence 0.86 0.88 0.90 0.92 0.94 0.96 0.98Reward β =0.025β =0.05 β =0.1 β =0.25 β =0.5 β =1.0 β =0.025β =0.05 β =0.1 β =0.25 β =0.5 β =1.0 IMDb Positive Text Generation: DPO vs LRML DPO LRML (a) DPO vs LRML 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 KL Divergence 0.86 0.88 0.90 0.92 0.94 0.96 0.98Reward IMDb Positive Text Generation: All DPO SLiC AQFL PADLL LRML (b) Discovered vs Baseline Losses Figure 5: Frontiers of expected reward vs KL divergence for converging models for the LRML against DPO and SLiC objective function. The rewards and KL-divergence values are averaged over 10 generations with different seeds. The sweep is done over β ∈ {0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0}. The optimal point is the top left corner, where the perfect reward is achieved with minimal divergence from the reference model. difference of log-ratios (ρ). Mathematically, the LRML function can be described with a temperature parameter τ = 0.05 as follows: flrml(βρ) = (σ(βρ/τ ) − 1) · fdpo(βρ) +σ(βρ/τ ) · fexp(βρ) (4) = (1− σ(βρ/τ )) · log(1 +exp(−βρ)) +σ(βρ/τ ) · exp(−βρ) (5) If the difference of log ratios is zero ( ρ = 0), which is at the start of the training when the model policy πθ is equal to the reference policy πref, then the loss is equally balanced between the logistic and exponential loss. If ρ → ∞, the model policy diverges from the reference policy and chosen outputs are preferred, then the exponential term dominates. This emphasizes larger differences more strongly. On the other hand, if ρ → −∞, the model policy diverges from the reference policy, and rejected outputs are preferred. In this case, the logistic loss can handle moderate differences well. The baseline objective losses and the LRML, the PADLL, and the AQFL functions are displayed in Figure 6, including their gradients. Surprisingly, the DiscoPOP function has a non-convex segment and negative gradients at the starting point ρ = 0. This is potentially helpful for introducing a curriculum or for stochasticity. Additional results and analysis of the discovered loss function can be found in Appendix D.6. − 10 0 10 20 30 40 Logitsρ 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5Lossf (ρ) Discovered Objective Functions AQFL PADLL LRML DPO SLiC (a) Discovered Objective Functions − 10 0 10 20 30 40 Logitsρ − 0.04 − 0.02 0.00 0.02 0.04 Gradientf ′(ρ) Gradient of Objective Functions AQFL PADLL LRML DPO SLiC (b) Gradients of the Discovered Objective Functions Figure 6: Figure 6a: Baseline objective functions DPO and SLiC, and the discovered ones, LRML, AQFL, and PADLL. Figure 6b: gradients of the objectives as a function of ρ and with fixed β = 0.05. 6.2 Limitations of DiscoPOP While performing very well on single-turn text generation and text summarization, we observed during the IMDb experiment that LRML struggles to converge when β is too low (β ≤ 0.01) or too high (β ≥ 2.5), likely because β ̸= 0.05 was never seen or used during the discovery process. 8In Figure 9 and Figure 10 of the Appendix, we plot the LRML objective function for β ∈ {0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5} against DPO. When β is high, the DiscoPOP objective function takes the form of the DPO log sigmoid loss. During training on β = 0.01, we observed that DiscoPOP gets stuck in generating predominantly negative reviews (resulting in a reward score of ∼ 0.15). We hypothesize that the loss is stuck in the local minima to the left with a negative difference in log ratios. While training with β ∈ {2.5, 5.0}, we observed that the model collapsed after a sharp spike in the loss and subsequently having loss value 0 and NaN outputs. This is potentially due to a large gradient in the non-convex part, which could be amended with gradient clipping. 7 Related Work Evolution and Search with Large Language Models. LLMs provide a fast and automated way to create multiple candidate solutions for a problem stated in natural language [Song et al., 2024], which makes them powerful tools for driving population-based search procedures. Various recent works have applied this approach to coding problems [Romera-Paredes et al., 2024], neural architecture search [Chen et al., 2024a, Holt et al., 2024b], virtual robotic design settings [Lehman et al., 2023], reward functions [Ma et al., 2023, Yu et al., 2023], and algorithm heuristics [Liu et al., 2024]. Finally, recently LLMs have shown to be capable of acting as recombination operators for black-box optimization with Evolution Strategies [Lange et al., 2024] and for Quality-Diversity approaches [Lim et al., 2024]. Automated Discovery for Machine Learning. There are many other approaches to automating the discovery of generalizable machine learning algorithms. Some prior works explore the space of ML functions using genetic algorithms and a hand-crafted domain-specific language for reinforcement learning algorithms [Co-Reyes et al., 2021], curiosity algorithms [Alet et al., 2020], and optimizers [Chen et al., 2024b]. Other works instead parameterize a transferrable objective function using neural networks and optimize them with evolution strategies or meta-gradients. For example, Lu et al. [2022], Jackson et al. [2024b], Houthooft et al. [2018], Alfano et al. [2024], Kirsch et al. [2019], Oh et al. [2020], Jackson et al. [2024a] discover policy optimization objectives, Metz et al. [2022] evolves neural network optimizers, and Lange et al. [2023b,a] evolve blackbox optimizers. Moreover, automatically discovering closed-form functions (i.e., symbolic regression), works exist that leverage RL [Petersen et al., 2020], gradient descent [Kacprzyk et al., 2024], RL with evolution strategies [Mundhenk et al., 2021], pre-training transformers [Biggio et al., 2021] and hybrid combinations of pre-training transformers, which are further refined with RL and evolution strategies [Holt et al., 2023b]. Preference Optimization Algorithms. While the reduction to supervised learning makes DPO and al- ternatives easier to use, other approaches have sought to simplify the RL step, including using variants of REINFORCE [Ahmadian et al., 2024, Gemma-Team et al., 2024] as well as more fine-grained feed- back [Wu et al., 2024] through preferences over individual steps in the reasoning process [Uesato et al., 2022, Lightman et al., 2023] or reward redistribution [Chan et al., 2024]. Others use iterative offline training interleaved with sampling from the policy model and obtaining a preference ranking from themselves [Xu et al., 2023], another judge LLM [Guo et al., 2024], or an oracle [Swamy et al., 2024]. 8 Conclusion Summary. In this paper, we proposed and used LLM-driven objective discovery to generate novel offline preference optimization algorithms. Specifically, we were able to discover high-performing preference optimization losses that achieve strong performance across held-out evaluation tasks, with the highest performing providing new insights into what an optimal objective may need to possess, such as being a blend of logistic and exponential losses and possibly being non-convex. Limitations & Future work . There are multiple limitations to our current approach. First, we have only scratched the surface of how to generate LLM objective proposals effectively. Initial exploratory experiments using techniques such as temperature sampling or worst-to-best performance sorting in the context did not yield significant improvements. But one could imagine leveraging more information about the training runs and automatically tuning instruction prompt templates. E.g. by providing entire learning curve plots to a Visual Language Model (see Figure 13) or by meta-meta- optimizing [Lu et al., 2023] the LLM prompt. Second, the highest-performing loss re-purposed β 9in the traditional sense, making it affect the functional behavior and the KL penalty of the model with respect to the base model. This motivates future work to study different forms, with perhaps multiple floating point parameters in the form, that each could be tuned separately. Although we provided an initial analysis sweep over this one single parameter and observed some instances of the functional behavior leading to instability of training the model, a further multi-parameter analysis, reformulating the objective, would be beneficial for future work. Finally, our work uses closed-source models (GPT-4) to generate code, which limits reproducibility and is costly to run. Future work could use the produced models themselves to generate code, resulting in code-level self-improvement. Broader Impact and Ethical Considerations . This paper presents an LLM-driven discovery in-context learning pipeline that is used to generate better-performing novel offline preference optimization algorithms. However, misuse of the pipeline as a tool or training an LLM to produce undesirable, unethical, or harmful outputs could be possible by a user. Furthermore, due to the use of LLMs and training of LLMs, the outputs are susceptible to hallucinations, motivating all outputs of the LLMs to always have a content filter applied to the outputs. Finally, this work takes a small step towards code-level self-improvement in language models, which could potentially result in unintended behaviors.

B Training Details B.1 Discovery Task - Single-turn Dialogue For each valid generated objective function fi, we use it to train an LLM and then collect a perfor- mance evaluation score. Specifically, we follow the same process when training and evaluating all objective functions, starting with a pre-trained supervised fine-tuned (SFT) 7 billion gemma model of ‘zephyr-7b-gemma-sft’ This is a 7 billion base version gemma [Gemma-Team et al., 2024] model supervised-fine-tuned on the ‘deita-10k-v0-sft’ dataset [Liu et al., 2023]. Starting with this model, we train it on the pairwise preference dataset of ‘Argilla DPO Mix 7K’; which attempts to create a high-quality preference dataset by filtering only highly rated chosen responses from the datasets of a multi-turn dataset, instruction following dataset [Longpre et al., 2023] and a diverse preference dataset that covers truthfulness, honesty and helpfulness [Cui et al., 2023]. For each training run, we trained all the parameters of the starting model, using a fixed β = 0.05. We used the same fixed hyper-parameters for all training runs unless explicitly noted. Specifically, we used a learning rate of 5e-7, bfloat16 floating-point format, two epochs, a batch size per device of two, a gradient accumula- tion step of 8, a cosine learning rate scheduler, and AdamW optimization algorithm [Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017]. We use the popular TRL transformers library [von Werra et al.], adapting the offline preference optimization objective function to train all models. The models were trained on 8 Nvidia A100 GPUs. An individual training run takes approximately 30 minutes. We provide training and evaluation statistics for discovered objective functions in Figure 7. We also provide the equivalent code implementation at https://github.com/vanderschaarlab/DiscoPOP. B.2 TL;DR Summarization To determine if the discovered objective functions generalize well also to other tasks, we use them to preference optimize an LLM for text summarization. Specifically, we start again with a pre-trained supervised fine-tuned (SFT) 7 billion gemma model of ‘zephyr-7b-gemma-sft’, and we optimized it with the objective function fi on a subsample of the Reddit TL;DR summarization preference dataset 190 20 40 60 80 100 Train Step 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Loss Train and Eval Loss DPO PADLL LRML SLiC Final Eval Loss (a) Loss 0 20 40 60 80 100 Train Step 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8Reward Accuracy Train and Eval Accuracy DPO PADLL LRML SLiC Final Eval Accuracy (b) Accuracy Figure 7: Training and eval statistics of DPO, SLiC, PADLL, and LRML. The losses are not directly comparable to each other, as they are calculated differently for each model. Interestingly, eval results are not strongly correlated with the downstream MT-Bench scores, as LRML achieves the worst accuracy. [Völske et al., 2017]6. More precisely we use the first 10% of the dataset for preference optimization, which amounts to around 8’000 training samples. During training the hyperparameters are kept the same as in the single-turn dialogue task, explained in subsection B.1, except that LLMs were trained 4 Nvidia A100 GPUS using a gradient accumulation step of 16. An individual training run takes approximately 1.5 hours. B.3 IMDb Positive Text Generation Another popular generalization task for preference optimization [Rafailov et al., 2023] is to fine-tune a small LLM to generate positive text for movie review, based on the IMDb sentiment dataset [Maas et al., 2011]7 following the the work of Zhou et al. [2024]. As a starting model, we use a GPT2 model [Radford et al., 2019], that was supervised fine-tuned on the IMDb dataset8. Subsequently, we apply the baseline and discovered objective function fi for preference optimization. The goal of the LLM is to give a short prompt of 2-8 tokens, which indicate the start of a movie review, to generate a positive review. As we are interested in the effect ofβ on the rewards and KL-Divergence, we train the objective functions over a sweep of β ∈ {0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5}. Every LLM is trained for three epochs, using the AdamW optimizer, with an initial learning rate of 5.0e-5, a warm-up scheduler of 0.1, and a cosine learning rate scheduler. The models are trained on 4 Nvidia A100 GPUs, using a gradient accumulation step of 8, and a batch size per device of 2. The training takes around 30 minutes. C Evaluation Metrics C.1 MT-Bench To assess the fitness of the discovered preference optimization loss function during the discovery phase, we evaluate the trained LLMs on the MT-Bench [Zheng et al., 2024] benchmark. The evaluation benchmark consists of 80 high-quality multi-turn questions from various disciplines. The goal is to assess LLM’s ability to follow instructions and keep the flow of a conversation. A larger LLM, in our case GPT-4, is then used as a judge to score the quality of the answers with a number from 0 (lowest) to 10 (highest). Scores are given based on the quality of the LLM’s first-turn answer (single-turn) and first and second answers (multi-turn). Finally, the MT-Bench score is the average 6https://huggingface.co/datasets/CarperAI/openai_summarize_comparisons 7https://huggingface.co/datasets/ZHZisZZ/imdb_preference 8https://huggingface.co/lvwerra/gpt2-imdb 20of single-turn and multi-turn scores. For answer generation and evaluation, we used the FastChat library9 and its standard sampling and temperature parameters, provided by Zheng et al. [2024]. C.2 Alpaca Eval Alpaca Eval 2.0 [Li et al., 2023, Dubois et al., 2023, 2024] is also a popular benchmark for evaluating LLMs. This is a single-turn dialogue LLM-based automatic evaluation using a stronger LLM, here GPT-4 Turbo, to assess the win rate of the trained LLM policy’s completion compared to either GPT-4 or the of the underlying SFT base model. Specifically, Alpaca Eval 2.0 has been validated against 20K human annotations and aims to reduce the length bias of Alpaca Eval, where using length-controlled (LC) Alpaca Eval shows a correlation with Chatbot Arena of 0.98, making it a popular benchmark with the highest correlation to Chatbot Arena [Dubois et al., 2024]. The Alpaca evaluation dataset consists of 841 high-quality instructions from different data sets. The library10 provided by Dubois et al. [2024] calculates the win-rate (percentage were the trained policy is prefered over the reference policy, first introduced in Alpaca Eval 1.0), and a length-controlled win-rate, where a linear model is fitted to de-bias for length of the prompt and instruction difficulty. We used a temperature of 0.7, sampling, and a maximum number of new tokens of 1024 to generate the answers. Furthermore, the library provides the standard error of the mean, which indicates the confidence of the win-rate and LC win-rate. C.3 TL;DR Summarization Win-Rate To evaluate how well the discovered objective functions generalize to the summarization task, we use the Alpaca Eval 2.0 library, similar to subsection C.2. Instead of using the Alpaca evaluation dataset, we create a custom dataset of 694 samples from the IMDb preference test dataset. Additionally, we change the prompt of the annotator LLM, to fit the \"Summarization GPT-4 win rate prompt (C)\" as described in Rafailov et al. [2023]. The (LC) win-rate is calculated against either the existing human-chosen test sample or against the summary generated by the SFT reference model. For a summary generation, we apply a temperature parameter of 0.7, sampling, and a maximum of 256 new tokens. Moreover, we stop the summarization after the \"\\n\" token to avoid nonsensical generations. Furthermore, as we cannot calculate an instruction difficulty for the length-controlled win-rate, we omit this term from the linear model (This has only a small impact on the metric). In addition to the win-rates we also provide the standard error as a measure of confidence. C.4 IMDb Rewards vs KL-Divergence For the positive text generation, we do not require an LLM judge compared to MT-Bench, Alpaca Eval 2.0, and TL;DR evaluation, as we take a pre-trained sentiment classifier11 as ground truth reward scorer. The LLMs apply sampling and a maximum of 60 new tokens for the positive text generation. The rewards and KL-divergence are averaged over 10 different generations from the trained LLMs. 9https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat 10https://github.com/tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval 11https://huggingface.co/siebert/sentiment-roberta-large-english 21D Additional Results D.1 Frontiers of Expected Reward vs KL Divergence 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 KL Divergence 0.86 0.88 0.90 0.92 0.94 0.96 0.98Reward β =0.025β =0.05 β =0.1 β =0.25 β =0.5 β =1.0 β =0.025β =0.05 β =0.1 β =0.25 β =0.5 β =1.0 IMDb Positive Text Generation: DPO vs LRML DPO LRML (a) SLiC vs LRML 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 KL Divergence 0.86 0.88 0.90 0.92 0.94 0.96 0.98Reward β =0.025 β =0.05 β =0.1 β =0.25 β =0.5β =1.0 β =0.025β =0.05 β =0.1 β =0.25 β =0.5 β =1.0 IMDb Positive Text Generation: SLiC vs LRML SLiC LRML (b) SLiC vs LRML 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 KL Divergence 0.86 0.88 0.90 0.92 0.94 0.96 0.98Reward β =0.025β =0.05 β =0.1 β =0.25 β =0.5 β =1.0 β =0.025β =0.05 β =0.1 β =0.25 β =0.5 β =1.0 IMDb Positive Text Generation: DPO vs PADLL DPO PADLL (c) DPO vs PADLL 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 KL Divergence 0.86 0.88 0.90 0.92 0.94 0.96 0.98Reward β =0.025 β =0.05 β =0.1 β =0.25 β =0.5β =1.0 β =0.025 β =0.05 β =0.1 β =0.25 β =0.5 β =1.0 IMDb Positive Text Generation: SLiC vs PADLL SLiC PADLL (d) SLiC vs PADLL 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 KL Divergence 0.86 0.88 0.90 0.92 0.94 0.96 0.98Reward β =0.025β =0.05 β =0.1 β =0.25 β =0.5 β =1.0 β =0.025β =0.05 β =0.1 β =0.25 β =0.5 β =1.0 IMDb Positive Text Generation: DPO vs AQFL DPO AQFL (e) DPO vs AQFL 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 KL Divergence 0.86 0.88 0.90 0.92 0.94 0.96 0.98Reward β =0.025 β =0.05 β =0.1 β =0.25 β =0.5β =1.0 β =0.025β =0.05 β =0.1 β =0.25 β =0.5 β =1.0 IMDb Positive Text Generation: SLiC vs AQFL SLiC AQFL (f) SLiC vs AQFL Figure 8: Frontiers of expected reward vs KL divergence after convergence for the baseline functions and all the discovered ones.

The optimal point is the top left corner, where perfect reward is achieved with minimal divergence from the reference model, to avoid reward hacking. 22D.2 Loss Sweeps for Different Beta Parameters −20 0 20 40 Logits ρ 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8Loss f (ρ) β =0.01 DPO LRML −20 0 20 40 Logits ρ 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Loss f (ρ) β =0.025 DPO LRML −20 0 20 40 Logits ρ 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2Loss f (ρ) β =0.05 DPO LRML −20 0 20 40 Logits ρ 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0Loss f (ρ) β =0.1 DPO LRML −20 0 20 40 Logits ρ 0 1 2 3 4 5Loss f (ρ) β =0.25 DPO LRML −20 0 20 40 Logits ρ 0 2 4 6 8 10Loss f (ρ) β =0.5 DPO LRML −20 0 20 40 Logits ρ 0 5 10 15 20Loss f (ρ) β =1 DPO LRML −20 0 20 40 Logits ρ 0 10 20 30 40 50Loss f (ρ) β =2.5 DPO LRML −20 0 20 40 Logits ρ 0 20 40 60 80 100Loss f (ρ) β =5 DPO LRML Comparison of DPO vs LRML for different β Values Figure 9: DPO and LRML objective function over β ∈ {0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5}. −20 0 20 40 Logits ρ −0.0075 −0.0050 −0.0025 0.0000 0.0025 0.0050 0.0075 Loss Gradient ∇ ρf (ρ) β =0.01 DPO LRML −20 0 20 40 Logits ρ −0.02 −0.01 0.00 0.01 0.02 Loss Gradient ∇ ρf (ρ) β =0.025 DPO LRML −20 0 20 40 Logits ρ −0.04 −0.02 0.00 0.02 0.04 Loss Gradient ∇ ρf (ρ) β =0.05 DPO LRML −20 0 20 40 Logits ρ −0.05 0.00 0.05 Loss Gradient ∇ ρf (ρ) β =0.1 DPO LRML −20 0 20 40 Logits ρ −0.2 −0.1 0.0 0.1 0.2 Loss Gradient ∇ ρf (ρ) β =0.25 DPO LRML −20 0 20 40 Logits ρ −0.4 −0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 Loss Gradient ∇ ρf (ρ) β =0.5 DPO LRML −20 0 20 40 Logits ρ −1.0 −0.5 0.0 0.5 Loss Gradient ∇ ρf (ρ) β =1 DPO LRML −20 0 20 40 Logits ρ −2 −1 0 1 2 Loss Gradient ∇ ρf (ρ) β =2.5 DPO LRML −20 0 20 40 Logits ρ −4 −2 0 2 4 Loss Gradient ∇ ρf (ρ) β =5 DPO LRML Comparison of DPO vsLRML Gradients for Different β Values Figure 10: DPO and LRML gradient function over β ∈ {0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5}. 23D.3 Discovery Robustness with respect to LLM Hyperparameters Figure 11: Robustness of the LLM-driven discovery process. Left. We compare different sampling temper- atures {0.1, 0.5.1.0}. Middle. The default configuration includes all objective proposals and evaluations in chronological order. Here we also explore using only the top-K performing objectives unsorted and sorted by their performance. Right. We also investigate whether using a \"thought\" as part of the context and whether to include non-valid code and error messages improves performance. The discovery process for CIFAR-10 objectives (5 epochs) is robust to these settings. The results are averaged across 3 independent runs. D.4 LLM-Driven Discovery Analysis Figure 12: LLM-driven discovery for CIFAR-10 loss functions with (left) and without (right) providing fitness feedback. Note that without feedback, it performs worse but also is unable to refine its ideas, resulting in fewer improvements across generations. D.5 Visual Language Models for Objective Discovery Figure 13: Objective Discovery with a Visual Language Model (VLM) for CIFAR-10 (20 epochs). We provide a plot of the training and validation accuracy across training as context components to the VLM (GPT-4-Turbo). 24D.6 Additional Analysis of DiscoPOP We performed further analysis to improve our understanding of the discovered loss function. We hypothesize that the local optimum of the DiscoPOP loss could catch noisy or incorrect data points. By inspecting the DiscoPOP loss values and log ratios of the training preference pairs in the IMDb dataset, we see that 1.35% of training points fall there (see Figure 14). Although we use the binary preference labels from the IMDb dataset12 for training, the dataset also includes a positivity reward score for each completion, calculated by a separate reward model. When we analyze the data points between the local optima, we find that the positive and negative completions are significantly closer in absolute reward difference than those outside the local optimum (See Table 4). This implies that the preference labels on those points are likely more challenging to distinguish and help empirically validate our hypothesis. Figure 14: Distribution of β-scaled difference of log-ratios (left y-axis) and corresponding DiscoPOP loss value (right y-axis) of the training samples on the IMDb positive review generation task. The DiscoPOP function has a local minimum at flrml(−2.3714) = 0.785929 and a local maximum at flrml(1.44012) = 0.87829. The number of samples within the two local optima corresponds to 1.35% of the training set. Description Domain βρ Mean 95%-CI p-value % of training set Between optima [−2.3714, 1.44012] 0.981 (0.830, 1.131) - 1.35 Full range R 3.861 (3.818, 3.904) < 0.01% 100 Outside optima R\\[−2.3714, 1.44012] 3.9 (3.857, 3.944) < 0.01% 98.65 Below local minimum (−∞, −2.3714) 4.086 (4.041, 4.131) < 0.01% 6.22 Above local maximum (1.44012, ∞) 1.141 (1.076, 1.206) 4.29% 92.43 Table 4: The IMDb positive review preference dataset also provides “golden reward” scores for the chosen responses rw and rejected responses rl, calculated with a strong sentiment classifier (log p(pos) − log p(neg)). We analysed the absolute difference in reward scores between the chosen and rejected responses |rw − rl| across the different domains of the DiscoPOP function and report the statistics here. Training samples within the optima have a significantly lower mean absolute difference in rewards compared to the other regions in the DiscoPOP loss function. The samples stuck within the optima are the training triplets where the chosen and rejected responses are “closest” to each other and likely the most “noisy” labels. E Discovered Objective Functions To describe the discovered losses mathematically, we define three existing preference optimization losses here: fdpo(βρ) =−log(σ(βρ)) =−log( 1 1 +exp(−βρ)) =log(1 +exp(−βρ)) (6) fslic(βρ) =ReLU(1 − βρ) (7) 12https://huggingface.co/datasets/ZHZisZZ/imdb_preference 25fexp(βρ) =exp(−βρ) (8) Moreover, we display the code of the discovered losses as it is output by the LLM. In addition, we provide a mathematical representation of each, which we have adapted to be consistent with β being the KL-Divergence regularization parameter. This is because the generated code for LRML, DBAQL, AQL, AQFL, and PFL did not uphold theβ ought to be multiplied with the difference of log-ratios before any further calculations. If this was not upheld, it could lead to the loss function changing shapes based on the KL-regularization term, and therefore, models could not converge or potentially collapse. In future work, we should constrain the exploring LLM to uphold the β multiplication with the input before any other calculations are done with the difference of log-ratios ρ. As the meta-exploration was done with a set β = 0.05, and we wish to keep consistent with this scale of regularization, we have adapted the losses by dividing ρ values used in intermediate calculations with a scalar τ = 0.05. In the IMDb experiment in Section 5, we have thus used the corrected version of codes for the discovered losses based on the provided mathematical representation, as we were most interested in the effect of the KL-divergence compared to the model rewards.

Evolution and Search with Large Language Models. LLMs provide a fast and automated way to create multiple candidate solutions for a problem stated in natural language [Song et al., 2024], which makes them powerful tools for driving population-based search procedures. Various recent works have applied this approach to coding problems [Romera-Paredes et al., 2024], neural architecture search [Chen et al., 2024a, Holt et al., 2024b,d], virtual robotic design settings [Lehman et al., 2023], reward functions [Ma et al., 2023, Yu et al., 2023], and algorithm heuristics [Liu et al., 2024]. Finally, recently LLMs have shown to be capable of acting as recombination operators for black-box optimization with Evolution Strategies [Lange et al., 2024] and for Quality-Diversity approaches [Lim et al., 2024]. Additionally, prior work has shown LLM multi-agent frameworks’ ability to excel at large code-generation tasks [Holt et al., 2024c], which we could envision enabling scaling up searching for larger candidate solutions for more complicated objectives or algorithms than the existing approaches that fit within the LLMs output context window. Automated Discovery for Machine Learning. There are many other approaches to automating the discovery of generalizable machine learning algorithms. Some prior works explore the space of ML functions using genetic algorithms and a hand-crafted domain-specific language for reinforcement learning algorithms [Co-Reyes et al., 2021], curiosity algorithms [Alet et al., 2020], and optimizers [Chen et al., 2024b]. Other works instead parameterize a transferrable objective function using neural networks and optimize them with evolution strategies or meta-gradients. For example, Lu et al. [2022], Jackson et al. [2024b], Houthooft et al. [2018], Alfano et al. [2024], Kirsch et al. [2019], Oh et al. [2020], Jackson et al. [2024a] discover policy optimization objectives, Metz et al. [2022] evolves neural network optimizers, and Lange et al. [2023b,a] evolve blackbox optimizers. Moreover, automatically discovering closed-form functions (i.e., symbolic regression), works exist that leverage RL [Petersen et al., 2020], gradient descent [Kacprzyk et al., 2024], RL with evolution strategies [Mundhenk et al., 2021], pre-training transformers [Biggio et al., 2021] and hybrid combinations of pre-training transformers, which are further refined with RL and evolution strategies [Holt et al., 2023b]. Furthermore, more general-purpose ML approaches exist to perform sequential modeling of 30processes [Holt et al., 2022], which can be readily used in model-based RL approaches [Holt et al., 2023a, 2024a]. Preference Optimization Algorithms. While the reduction to supervised learning makes DPO and al- ternatives easier to use, other approaches have sought to simplify the RL step, including using variants of REINFORCE [Ahmadian et al., 2024, Gemma-Team et al., 2024] as well as more fine-grained feed- back [Wu et al., 2024] through preferences over individual steps in the reasoning process [Uesato et al., 2022, Lightman et al., 2023] or reward redistribution [Chan et al., 2024]. Others use iterative offline training interleaved with sampling from the policy model and obtaining a preference ranking from themselves [Xu et al., 2023], another judge LLM [Guo et al., 2024], or an oracle [Swamy et al., 2024]. G Full Run Log We provide a full run below, formatted for readability. ========== thought Since the logistic log loss currently has the highest fitness and is a direct optimization of the log likelihood ratio , let ’s try a variation that includes a margin in the log likelihood ratios , inspired by the concept of a margin in SVM hinge loss . Introducing a margin could create a buffer that leads to more robust learning , as seen in SVMs . name logistic_margin_loss code def logistic_margin_loss ( self , policy_chosen_logps : torch .

Please generate the next one . ========== thought The logistic margin loss outperformed the hinge and ipo losses but did not surpass the original logistic log loss . Perhaps introducing an adaptive margin based on the confidence in the predictions could yield improvements . The margin could be set proportional to the absolute difference between the policy ’s and the reference ’s log probabilities . This could potentially penalize incorrect confident predictions more heavily . name adaptive_margin_logistic_loss code def adaptive_margin_logistic_loss ( self , policy_chosen_logps : torch .

Please generate the next one . ========== thought The adaptive margin did not yield an improvement . It might have introduced too much variability or penalization . Let ’s go back to a fixed structure but combine elements from both logistic loss and hinge loss , with the idea of encouraging a larger margin when the decision is correct , while still having a soft , probabilistic interpretation . This combined loss could retain the benefits of both worlds . name combined_logistic_hinge_loss code def combined_logistic_hinge_loss ( self , policy_chosen_logps : torch .

Please generate the next one . ========== thought The combined logistic and hinge loss slightly outperformed the baseline logistic log loss but still did not achieve a significant improvement . Considering the nature of RLHF , where we prefer the model to be correct but not overly confident , we can explore a scaled version of the combined loss where the logistic part is emphasized more heavily , as it intrinsically accounts for confidence due to its probabilistic nature . name scaled_combined_logistic_hinge_loss code def scaled_combined_logistic_hinge_loss ( self , policy_chosen_logps : torch . FloatTensor , policy_rejected_logps : torch . FloatTensor , reference_chosen_logps : torch . FloatTensor , reference_rejected_logps : torch . FloatTensor , ) -> torch .

Please generate the next one . ========== thought The scaled combined loss has shown an improvement , which indicates that balancing the contribution between the logistic and hinge components is beneficial . To further expand on this idea , we could try a form of annealing where early in training we use more of the logistic component , encouraging better probability estimation , and later on a switch gradually to the hinge component , emphasizing decisions with a margin . We ’ll simulate this by using a weighting factor that changes linearly through the logits , giving lower logits ( earlier , less confident predictions ) a higher weight for the logistic loss . name annealed_combined_logistic_hinge_loss code def annealed_combined_logistic_hinge_loss ( self , policy_chosen_logps : torch .

Please generate the next one . ========== thought The annealed combined loss did not yield the expected improvement and performed worse than the scaled version . It ’s possible the transition from logistic to hinge was too aggressive . For the next iteration , let ’s return to a simpler concept and try a variation of the logistic loss with a squared term , similar to squared hinge loss , which might penalize incorrect predictions more smoothly than the linear term used in the standard logistic loss . name 33squared_logistic_loss code def squared_logistic_loss ( self , policy_chosen_logps : torch . FloatTensor , policy_rejected_logps : torch . FloatTensor , reference_chosen_logps : torch . FloatTensor , reference_rejected_logps : torch . FloatTensor , ) -> torch . FloatTensor : pi_logratios = policy_chosen_logps - policy_rejected_logps ref_logratios = reference_chosen_logps - reference_rejected_logps logits = pi_logratios - ref_logratios logistic_losses = -F. logsigmoid ( self . beta * logits ) squared_losses = logistic_losses ** 2 return squared_losses ========== Fitness : 7.60062893081761. Please generate the next one . ========== thought The squared logistic loss did not perform as well as hoped , possibly due to excessive penalization of difficult samples . This time , let ’s integrate a weighting mechanism that focuses on hard examples while using the logistic component . Inspired by the focal loss used in object detection , which gives more weight to harder , misclassified examples , we can apply a similar mechanism to emphasize learning from examples where the policy significantly differs from the reference . name focal_logistic_loss code def focal_logistic_loss ( self , policy_chosen_logps : torch . FloatTensor , policy_rejected_logps : torch . FloatTensor , reference_chosen_logps : torch . FloatTensor , reference_rejected_logps : torch . FloatTensor , ) -> torch .

Please generate the next one . ========== thought The focal logistic loss seems to have a moderate effect , indicating that prioritizing hard examples has some merit . To build on this , an alternative could be to apply temperature scaling to the logits before computing the logistic loss . Temperature scaling is often used in model calibration and can soften the probability distribution , which might work well with RLHF where overconfidence in predictions is undesirable . name temperature_scaled_logistic_loss code 34def temperature_scaled_logistic_loss ( self , policy_chosen_logps : torch .

Please generate the next one . ========== thought The temperature scaling seemed to have a positive impact , possibly due to better - calibrated probability estimates . To further explore this direction , we can try using label smoothing , which encourages the model not to be too confident about its predictions by preventing it from assigning full probability to a single class . It ’s a technique commonly used in classification tasks and might be beneficial for RLHF . name label_smoothed_logistic_loss code def label_smoothed_logistic_loss ( self , policy_chosen_logps : torch .

Let ’s adjust the implementation to make sure the loss retains the correct shape , by performing the mean operation separately for the positive and negative parts and then combining them , weighted appropriately . name 35corrected_label_smoothed_logistic_loss code def corrected_label_smoothed_logistic_loss ( self , policy_chosen_logps : torch .

Please generate the next one . ========== thought The corrected label smoothing implementation didn ’t work as intended and significantly decreased the fitness . It seems that label smoothing may not align well with the objective of RLHF . In light of this , let ’s explore a different direction by introducing a decaying weight on older samples . The idea is to give higher importance to the more recent decisions made by the policy , under the assumption that they may be more aligned with the current state of the policy . name decaying_weights_logistic_loss code def decaying_weights_logistic_loss ( self , policy_chosen_logps : torch .

Please generate the next one . ========== thought 36While the decaying weights logistic loss provided a slight increase in fitness , it suggests that emphasizing more recent samples can be beneficial , but the approach might need some refinement . We could potentially improve this by making the decay adaptive based on the performance of each choice . The idea would be to give less weight to choices that are heavily mismatched with the reference , under the hypothesis that these could be outliers or errors . name performance_adaptive_decay_logistic_loss code def performance_adaptive_decay_logistic_loss ( self , policy_chosen_logps : torch .

Please generate the next one . ========== thought The performance - adaptive decay approach provided a slight improvement in fitness , suggesting that dynamically adjusting the loss based on the correctness of predictions is a promising direction . To take this further , let ’s create a hybrid approach which combines the performance - adaptive decay with a form of margin - based loss . This will aim to reduce the weights of not only the incorrect predictions but also those that are correct yet lack confidence , thereby promoting a more decisive policy . name hybrid_performance_margin_decay_logistic_loss code def hybrid_performance_margin_decay_logistic_loss ( self , policy_chosen_logps : torch .

Please generate the next one . ========== thought The hybrid approach with the performance margin decay did not achieve the desired effectiveness . Introducing a margin may have been too punitive on correct predictions that are close to the boundary . To maintain the balance , let ’s explore the idea of using a triplet - style loss , which is popular in embedding learning . By treating the chosen policy logs as the anchor and the reference chosen and rejected logs as positive and negative examples , respectively , we can encourage the chosen policy decisions to be closer to the reference chosen decisions and farther away from the reference rejected decisions . name triplet_style_logistic_loss code def triplet_style_logistic_loss ( self , policy_chosen_logps : torch .

Error : isnan (): argument ’input ’ ( position 1) must be Tensor , not NoneType Please generate the next one . ========== thought It seems there was an error in the triplet - style loss function , which suggests that the computation may have been incorrect or incomplete . To correct this , we need to ensure that all intermediate steps yield non - empty tensors .

The primary goal of language generation is to learn the underlying probability distribution of a given text corpus. To achieve this, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is commonly employed to estimate the parameters of a probability distribution that best explains the text corpus (Myung, 2003). Maximum likelihood estimation is generally performed by minimizing the log-likelihood loss, also known as the log- arithmic score, a prominent example of a strictly proper scoring rule (Good, 1952; Gneiting & Raftery, 2007). In statistical decision theory, scoring rules serve as quantitative measures to assess the quality of probabilistic predictions, by assigning a numerical score based on the predicted distri- bution and the observed sample. A scoring rule is considered strictly proper if it encourages models to report their true beliefs or probabilities. In other words, the expected score is maximized only when the model reports true probabili- ties, and any deviation from the truth will result in a lower expected score. Due to this property, strictly proper scoring rules are well-suited as loss functions for calibrating prob- abilistic models (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017). This is exemplified by the logarithmic score, which corresponds to the log-likelihood loss. In addition to the logarithmic score, there are other strictly proper scoring rules that provide attractive loss functions for probabilistic prediction problems (Shoemaker, 1991; Hung et al., 1996; Kline & Berardi, 2005; Hui & Belkin, 2021). However, only the logarithmic score has wide applications in language generation, primarily because it is the only strictly proper scoring rule that is also local: it depends ex- clusively on the predictive probability of the observed sam- ple (Good, 1952; Shuford Jr et al., 1966; Bernardo, 1979). Given the exponentially large sample space for natural text, calculating the score based on the entire probability distribu- tion is infeasible, which hinders the application of non-local scoring rules in language modeling. Consequently, the loga- rithmic score, being both local and strictly proper, remains the only scoring rule capable of handling the exponentially large sample space of natural text. Nevertheless, the loga- rithmic score has faced criticism for its unbounded nature and sensitivity to small perturbations in the predicted dis- tribution (Selten, 1998), suggesting that alternative strictly 1 arXiv:2405.18906v1  [cs.CL]  29 May 2024Language Generation with Strictly Proper Scoring Rules proper scoring rules might offer more suitable and robust options for training and evaluation in specific scenarios. To investigate the impact and potential benefits of training language models with alternative strictly proper scoring rules, we propose a straightforward strategy for adapting non-local scoring rules to serve as loss functions for lan- guage generation. Specifically, we distribute the scoring rule at the token level to promote well-calibrated prediction of conditional probabilities at each time step, consequently leading to well-calibrated sequence-level probability pre- dictions. We further introduce score smoothing to enable honest label smoothing for arbitrary scoring rules. Our ap- proach allows language modeling with any non-local scor- ing rules while ensuring that the expected loss is minimized only when the model produces the desired probabilities. Leveraging this strategy, we train language generation mod- els using two classic strictly proper scoring rules, the Brier score (Brier, 1950) and the Spherical score (Roby, 1965), as alternatives to the logarithmic score. Experimental results indicate that simply substituting the loss function, without adjusting other hyperparameters, can yield substantial improvements in the model’s generation capabilities. Moreover, these improvements can scale up to large language models (LLMs) such as LLaMA-7B and LLaMA-13B. 2. Strictly Proper Scoring Rules In this section, we provide essential background on strictly proper scoring rules, including the definition and several popular examples. 2.1. Scoring Rules Scoring rules assign a numerical score based on the pre- dicted distribution and the observed sample. Let X = {1, ..., m} represents the discrete sample space consisting of a finite number m of different samples, and Pm = {p = (p1, ..., pm) : p1, ..., pm ≥ 0, Pm i=1 pi = 1} be the set of probability measures on X. A scoring rule S(p, i) takes val- ues in the extended real line R = [−∞, ∞], indicating the reward or utility of predicting p when sample i is observed: S(p, i) :Pm × X 7→R. (1) Assuming samples conform to a data distribution q, we denote S(p, q) as the expected score: S(p, q) =Ei∼q[S(p, i)] = mX i=1 qi · S(p, i). (2) 2.2. Propriety A scoring rule is proper if the expected score is maximized when the model reports true probabilities: S(p, q) ≤ S(q, q), ∀p, q∈ Pm. (3) It is strictly proper when the equality holds if and only if p = q. Propriety is an essential requirement for training and evaluating probabilistic models (Br ¨ocker & Smith, 2007; Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017). In terms of training, strictly proper scoring rules can serve as training criteria to calibrate probabilistic models for well-calibrated prediction. In terms of evaluation, strictly proper scoring rules assess the quality of probabilistic predictions by measuring how they align with the true probabilities. 2.3. Locality A scoring rule is local if the probabilistic prediction is eval- uated only at the observed sample, which means that there exists an equivalent function Slocal(pi, i) that satisfies: S(p, i) =Slocal(pi, i), ∀p ∈ Pm, i∈ X. (4) A local scoring rule depends exclusively on the probability of the observed sample, rather than being rewarded for other features of the probabilistic distribution, such as its shape. It has been proven that every scoring rule being both proper and local is equivalent to the logarithmic score (Bernardo, 1979). Formally, if S is both proper and local, then for some constant A and function B, we have: S(p, i) =A log pi + B(i). (5) 2.4. Examples We provide some examples of strictly proper scoring rules below. Logarithmic score.The logarithmic score is a local scoring rule that measures the log probability of the observed sample. It is defined as: S(p, i) = logpi. (6) This scoring rule is closely related to maximum likelihood estimation and is widely used in language modeling. Despite its widespread use, the logarithmic score has been criticized for being unbounded and sensitive to small perturbations in the predicted distribution (Selten, 1998). Brier score. The Brier score (Brier, 1950) is a quadratic scoring rule that measures the mean squared difference be- tween the predicted distribution and the true outcome. It is defined as: S(p, i) = 1− mX j=1 (δij − pj)2 = 2pi − mX j=1 p2 j , (7) 2Language Generation with Strictly Proper Scoring Rules where δij = 1if i = j and δij = 0otherwise. The expected Brier score is S(p, q) = Pm i=1 q2 i − (pi − qi)2, which is maximized when p = q. A more general form is the α- power score (Selten, 1998): S(p, i) =αpα−1 i − (α − 1) mX j=1 pα j , α >1. (8) The α-power score defines a family of strictly proper scoring rules, with the Brier score being a special case for α = 2. Spherical score. The spherical score (Roby, 1965) mea- sures the cosine similarity between the predicted probability vector and the true probability vector. It is defined as: S(p, i) = pi |p|. (9) The expected spherical score, S(p, q) =⟨p, q⟩/|p|, is pro- portional to the cosine similarity and is therefore maximized when p = q. A more general form is the pseudo-spherical score: S(p, i) = pα−1 i (Pm j=1 pα j ) α−1 α , α >1. (10) It reduces to the spherical score when α = 2. Note that both the α-power score and the pseudo-spherical score de- pend on the current prediction probability pi as well as the global characteristics of the distribution, i.e., the α-norm of p. Therefore, they are strictly proper but non-local. In addition to the classic scores introduced above, strictly proper scoring rules can also be constructed from any bounded strictly convex function on Pm. Please refer to Gneiting & Raftery (2007) for a literature review. 3. Language Generation with Strictly Proper Scoring Rules In this section, we present our strategy for adapting non- local scoring rules to serve as loss functions for language generation. Section 3.1 introduces the framework of utiliz- ing scoring rules as loss functions. Section 3.2 describes our approach for distributing the scoring rule at the token level, which overcomes the locality constraint. Section 3.3 further adapts scoring rules to support regularization with label smoothing. For simplicity of notation, we focus on unconditional se- quence models in this section, where samplesx ∈ Xconsist of discrete tokens x = {x1, x2, ..., xT }. The data distribu- tion is represented by q(x), the model predicts the distri- bution pθ(x), and the scoring rule is denoted as S(pθ, x). The subsequent discussion can be directly extended to con- ditional sequence generation scenarios, such as translation and summarization tasks. 3.1. Scoring Rules as Losses Scoring rules assign a numerical score based on the pre- dicted distribution pθ and the observed sample x, which can be interpreted as the reward or utility of predicting pθ when sample x is observed. It is natural to maximize the scoring rule S by minimizing the associated loss function LS: LS(θ) =−S(pθ, q) =−Ex∼qS(pθ, x). (11) As long as S is strictly proper, the associated loss LS will have a unique minimizer pθ = q, encouraging the model to report the true distribution q. In sequence prediction problems, given the maximum length Tmax and vocabulary size V , the sample space has an ex- ponentially large size of V Tmax. This makes it intractable to calculate scoring rules that depend on global character- istics of the distribution, such as the Brier score and the spherical score. The logarithmic score, being both local and strictly proper, remains the only scoring rule capable of handling sequence prediction problems. The corresponding loss function is: Llog(θ) =−Ex∼q log pθ(x). (12) This loss function can also be derived from maximum like- lihood estimation and is commonly referred to as the log- likelihood loss or cross-entropy loss. 3.2. Token-Level Scoring Rules In general, sequence models do not directly compute the probability of entire sequences. Instead, they decompose the sequence probability into a product of token probabilities in an autoregressive manner: pθ(x) = TY t=1 pθ(xt|x<t). (13) This autoregressive decomposition transforms the sequence prediction task into a series of conditional token prediction tasks, where the sample space is reduced to V for each task. As long as the model predicts the accurate conditional token probability q(xt|x<t), it can correctly recover the sequence probability q(x). Therefore, we can distribute the scoring rule at the token-level to promote well-calibrated prediction for each token prediction task. In this way, we define the following loss based on token-level scoring rules: LS(θ) =−Ex∼q[ TX t=1 S(pθ(·|x<t), xt)] = − TX t=1 Ex<t∼q[ X xt q(xt|x<t)S(pθ(·|x<t), xt)] = − TX t=1 Ex<t∼q[S(pθ(·|x<t), q(·|x<t))]. (14) 3Language Generation with Strictly Proper Scoring Rules In the above equation, pθ(·|x<t) and qθ(·|x<t) are probabil- ity vectors of size |V |, representing the conditional proba- bility distributions of the next word given the history x<t. The equation shows that the loss is minimized only when each token-level scoring ruleS(pθ(·|x<t), q(·|x<t)) is max- imized. For strictly proper S, maximizing the score means matching every pθ(·|x<t) with q(·|x<t), consequently lead- ing to well-calibrated probability predictions pθ = q: pθ(x) = TY t=1 pθ(xt|x<t) = TY t=1 q(xt|x<t) =q(x). (15) Token-level score optimization allows for language model- ing with any non-local strictly proper scoring rules, such as the Brier score (Brier, 1950) and the spherical score (Roby, 1965). For the Brier score, the token-level loss is given by: LBrier (θ) =−Ex∼q TX t=1 2pθ(xt|x<t) − |pθ(·|x<t)|2. (16) The token-level loss for the spherical score is: LSpherical(θ) =−Ex∼q TX t=1 pθ(xt|x<t) |pθ(·|x<t)|. (17) For the logarithmic score, its token-level loss formulation is equivalent to the sequence-level one defined in Equation 12. 3.3. Score Smoothing In practical applications, it is not always expected for a model to perfectly fit the data distribution, as the label smoothing technique (Szegedy et al., 2016) might be em- ployed for regularization purposes. Label smoothing is typ- ically used in classification and sequence prediction tasks, where it modifies the cross-entropy loss by replacing the one-hot label vector with a soft label to avoid overconfident predictions. Suppose we have a label set X = {1, ..., m} and a label distribution q. Label smoothing with a smoothing factor ϵ encourages the model to produce a smooth distribution qϵ: qϵ i = (1− ϵ)qi + ϵ m. (18) The current label smoothing technique is limited to loss func- tions based on the logarithmic score. Here we introduce a general smoothing technique called score smoothing, which supports label smoothing for arbitrary scoring rules. Given a smoothing factor ϵ, the smoothed score Sϵ is defined as: Sϵ(p, i) = (1− ϵ) · S(p, i) + ϵ m · mX j=1 S(p, j). (19) Table 1.Expected scores when the model conducts or ignores score smoothing. Score Logarithmic Brier Spherical S(p = q, qϵ) −∞ 0.8020 0.9010 S(p = qϵ, qϵ) -0.7778 0.8119 0.9011 Ideally, score smoothing should be consistent with the goal of label smoothing, motivating the model to generate the desired smooth distribution qϵ. In this context, we define a smoothed score as proper if the expected score satisfies Sϵ(p, q) ≤ Sϵ(qϵ, q), and it is strictly proper when the equality only holds atp = qϵ. The following equation shows that Sϵ is strictly proper as long as S is strictly proper: Sϵ(p, q) = (1− ϵ) mX i=1 qiS(p, i) + ϵ m mX i=1 S(p, i) = mX i=1 ((1 − ϵ)qi + ϵ m) · S(p, i) = S(p, qϵ). (20) By definition, the expected smoothed score Sϵ(p, q) = S(p, qϵ) is maximized only when the model produces qϵ, proving that Sϵ is strictly proper as well. However, when applying score smoothing in practice, we observe that the smoothing term might be ignored in some scoring rules. This is primarily attributed to the correspond- ing loss being relatively flat around the optimal point qϵ. Since a nearly equivalent minimal loss can be achieved without taking the smoothing term into account, the model lacks enough incentive to perform label smoothing. Consider an example with the number of labels m = 100, a one-hot true probability q = (1, 0, 0, ...,0), and a smooth- ing factor ϵ = 0.1. Table 1 gives the expected score Sϵ(p, q) = S(p, qϵ) when the model produces p = q, qϵ respectively. The logarithmic score imposes −∞ score penalty for disregarding score smoothing with p = q. In contrast, the Brier score and the spherical score are bounded, which can only impose a relatively mild penalty when score smoothing is ignored. In particular, the spherical score ex- hibits nearly identical expected scores in both cases, causing the smoothing term to be almost disregarded. To address this limitation, we introduce a masked logarith- mic score to enhance the smoothing effect. In the target distribution qϵ, all labels have a probability of at least ϵ m . Therefore, labels with probabilities below this threshold can be considered under-smooth. We apply the logarith- mic score to further augment the smoothing term for these 4Language Generation with Strictly Proper Scoring Rules Table 2.Implementation details on different datasets.

Since the logarithmic score is only applied to under-smooth labels, it does not affect the propriety of the score. Formally, for strictly proper S, we have: Sϵ log(p, q) ≤ Sϵ(p, q) ≤ Sϵ(qϵ, q) =Sϵ log(qϵ, q). (22) Therefore, the expected score is maximized only when p = qϵ, implying that Sϵ log is strictly proper. Enhanced by the masked logarithmic score, it ensures a stronger incentive for the model to produce the desired smooth distribution qϵ. 4. Experiments 4.1. Setup Datasets. We primarily evaluate our method on machine translation and abstractive summarization. For machine translation, we conduct experiments on widely used transla- tion benchmarks under difference scales: WMT14 English- French (En-Fr, 35.8M pairs), WMT14 English-German (En-De, 4.5M pairs), TED bilingual dataset (10 directions, each with ∼200K pairs). For WMT datasets, we use new- stest2013 for validation and newstest2014 for test, and ap- ply BPE (Sennrich et al., 2016) with 32K merge opera- tions to learn a joint vocabulary on the tokenized data. For TED bilingual dataset, we use the pre-processed data used in Xu et al. (2021). The translation quality is measured by BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002). For abstractive summa- rization, We conduct experiments on the summarization benchmark CNN/DailyMail (311K pairs, Hermann et al., 2015). We use the non-anonymized variant following See et al. (2017); Liu et al. (2021). The summarization quality is measured with ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L (Lin, 2004). We adopt the settings of Transformer-base (Vaswani et al., 2017) for most datasets, except that we use Transformer-big for WMT14 En-Fr. Implementation details are provided in Table 2. Large Language Models.We further investigate the per- formance of scoring rules at a larger model scale. Due to the large computational cost of pre-training, we utilize two open-source large language models (LLaMA-7B and LLaMA-13B, Touvron et al., 2023) as our foundation mod- els, and only employ strictly proper scoring rules for instruc- tion tuning. We conduct instruction tuning using the Alpaca dataset by GPT4 (Wang et al., 2022; Taori et al., 2023), which comprises 52K instruction-following demonstrations. We keep the standard settings for instruction tuning on Al- paca, except that the log-likelihood loss is replaced with losses associated with other scoring rules. Similarly, the generative capability of LLMs is evaluated on machine translation and abstractive summarization. Besides, we also employ MT-bench, a multi-turn question set, to evaluate the open-ended question answering capabilities of LLMs. For machine translation, we follow previous works (Jiao et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023a; Zeng et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023) to evaluate the translation capability on four WMT22 translation tasks (Chinese-to-English, English-to- Chinese, German-to-English, and English-to-German). For text summarization, we follow Liu et al. (2023) to con- duct the evaluation on CNN/DailyMail Dataset. We employ beam search with a beam size of 4 for machine translation and 2 for summarization. The prompt for machine trans- lation is ”Translate the following sentences from [SRC] to [TGT].” The prompt for summarization is ”Write a brief and focused summary of the passage that follows.”. 4.2. Training from Scratch In our initial investigation, we evaluate the performance of various strictly proper scoring rules when training language generation models from scratch. We employ three typical scoring rules - the logarithmic score, the Brier score, and the spherical score - to train language generation models. Figure 1 displays their performance curves on three datasets: WMT14 En-De, WMT14 En-Fr, and CNN/DailyMail. The results indicate that, although all of these scoring rules are strictly proper, they still exhibit noticeable differences when training language generation models from scratch. Among the three datasets, the logarithmic score consistently converges the fastest and achieves the best performance. The spherical score follows, and the Brier score exhibits the slowest convergence and the lowest performance. We hypothesize that such differences may be attributed to two primary factors.

For instance, compared to the other two scores, the logarithmic score exhibits a larger gradient during the initial stages of training, which may facilitate model warmup and enable faster convergence. On the other hand, the hyperparameter settings we employed were ob- tained from previous works that used the logarithmic score for training (Vaswani et al., 2017). These settings may not be as well-suited for other scoring rules, resulting in their relatively inferior performance. Table 4.ROUGE scores on CNN/DailyMail.

Fine-tuning with Scoring Rules As we have already observed, it is relatively challenging for other scoring rules to surpass the performance of the loga- rithmic score when training from scratch. Here, we further explore the impact of using alternative scores for fine-tuning on models trained with the logarithmic score. We fine-tune from an earlier checkpoint to ensure the total number of training steps remains unchanged. We fix all hyperparame- ters and only modify the loss function to correspond with the alternative scores. Table 3 and Table 4 present the impact of fine-tuning on translation and summarization performance. As can be seen, even without adjusting hyperparameters for specific scores, fine-tuning with Brier score or Spherical score can still yield certain improvements on logarithmic score pre-trained mod- els. We conjecture that such improvements stem from the 6Language Generation with Strictly Proper Scoring Rules 0 10 20 30 40 50 Steps/K -4.0% -2.0% 0.0% 2.0% 4.0% Metrics_diff Fine-tune with Logarithmic score Logarithmic Brier Spherical BLEU 0 10 20 30 40 50 Steps/K -4.0% -2.0% 0.0% 2.0% 4.0% Metrics_diff Fine-tune with Brier score Logarithmic Brier Spherical BLEU 0 10 20 30 40 50 Steps/K -4.0% -2.0% 0.0% 2.0% 4.0% Metrics_diff Fine-tune with Spherical score Logarithmic Brier Spherical BLEU Figure 3.Performance curves on WMT14 En-De test set when fine-tuning with different scoring rules.

As different scor- ing rules follow unique optimization trajectories towards the same global optimum, fine-tuning with another score might aid the model in escaping its current trapped region, consequently leading to further performance improvements. We continue to explore the effectiveness of scoring rules on a larger model scale. During the instruction tuning of LLaMA- 7B and LLaMA-13B, we substitute the log-likelihood loss with loss functions associated with the Brier score and the spherical score. The translation and summarization perfor- mance are presented in Table 5 and Table 6, respectively. Due to memory constraints, we only assess the summariza- tion performance of LLaMA-7B. It is surprising to see that fine-tuning with alternative scoring rules can lead to more significant performance improvements on LLMs. Particu- larly on LLaMA-7B, both scores exhibit an average increase of over 3 BLEU points in translation quality, and the spheri- cal score also demonstrates an average improvement of over 3 ROUGE points in summarization performance. Figure 2 displays the multi-turn question-answering capa- bilities of LLMs. Models fine-tuned using the Brier score and the spherical score exhibit stronger overall performance, particularly in extraction and reasoning tasks. In contrast, the model fine-tuned with the logarithmic score is better at writing, roleplay, and STEM tasks.

Model Dynamics during Fine-tuning The above experiments show that fine-tuning with other scoring rules can enhance the generative capabilities of lan- guage generation models. However, it remains unclear what changes occur within the model during this process. In this section, we investigate the dynamics of the model during the fine-tuning process to better understand its impact. Specifi- cally, on the WMT14 En-De dataset, we pre-train the Trans- former using MLE loss and fine-tune it with various scoring rules. Then we track the changes of different scoring rules and also the BLEU score on the test set. Figure 3 illustrates their relative changes, calculated as S(pθ,q)−S(pθold,q) |S(pθold,q)| . As observed, when fine-tuning with the logarithmic score, all metrics fluctuate around their original values since the model is pre-trained with the same score. When fine-tuning with the Brier score or the spherical score, both scores show a certain improvement, accompanied by an increase in BLEU. In contrast, the logarithmic score experiences a significant drop. This interesting phenomenon implies that although different strictly proper scores share the same global optimum, their optimization trajectories might be conflicting, and these scores do not always align with the model’s generative capabilities. Therefore, comprehensively considering multiple scores during training can help the model achieve stronger generative capabilities. It also sug- gests that when assessing language models, a more accurate evaluation could be achieved by considering multiple scores collectively, rather than relying solely on the perplexity. 4.5. Pseudo-spherical Score and Power Score Previously, we explored the impact of Brier score and spher- ical score for training language generation models. Here, we 7Language Generation with Strictly Proper Scoring Rules Table 9.BLEU scores on the TED bilingual dataset.

Both scores include a parameter α, with Brier score and spherical score being their special cases when α = 2. To examine the impact of the parameter α, we conduct experiments on both Transformer-base and LLaMA-7B. Table 7 and Table 8 give the results on the WMT14 En-De test set and WMT22 test sets, respectively. Overall, a stable and superior performance is achieved at α = 2. When α > 2, the model performance typically experiences a noticeable decline. In contrast, the models can still maintain a competitive performance when α <2. 4.6. Effect of Score Smoothing Label smoothing is a commonly used regularization tech- nique for classification networks, particularly crucial in low- resource scenarios. Therefore, we conduct experiments on the TED bilingual dataset to examine whether score smoothing could yield a similar effect. First, we train Trans- former models using the smoothed and unsmoothed log- likelihood loss respectively, and then fine-tune them with the unsmoothed Brier and spherical score. The results are presented in Table 9. When not using label smoothing, fine- tuning with alternative scores brings noticeable improve- ments. However, for models trained with label smoothing, fine-tuning with unsmoothed scores may result in a perfor- mance decline, indicating the necessity of score smoothing. Next, we employ score smoothing techniques to fine-tune the Transformer w/ LS. For simplicity, we only report the average BLEU score in Table 10. The smoothed score Sϵ results in some improvement, but the impact is relatively minor. By enhancing the smoothing term with the masked logarithmic score, Sϵ log leads to a more noticeable improve- ment in performance, indicating that score smoothing can also serve as an effective regularization technique. 5. Related Work Strictly Proper Scoring Rules in Deep Learning.In ad- dition to the widely used logarithmic score, various strictly proper scoring rules have played a significant role in deep learning. The Brier score serves as a training criterion for classification networks (Shoemaker, 1991; Hung et al., 1996; Kline & Berardi, 2005; Hui & Belkin, 2021), as well as an evaluation metric for the quality of uncertainty calibration (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017; Ovadia et al., 2019; Gruber & Buettner, 2022). The pseudo-spherical score offers solu- tions for training energy-based models (Yu et al., 2021) and knowledge distillation (Lee & Lee, 2022). In the continu- ous space, some scoring rules present appealing generative modeling approaches. For example, the Hyv ¨arinen score (Hyv¨arinen & Dayan, 2005; Ehm & Gneiting, 2012) gives rise to score-based generative models (Song & Ermon, 2019; Song et al., 2021). The energy and kernel score (Gneiting & Raftery, 2007) facilitate the development of generative net- works through scoring rule minimization (Gritsenko et al., 2020; Pacchiardi et al., 2021; Pacchiardi & Dutta, 2022). Loss Functions for Language Generation.Currently, the loss functions used in language generation models are pri- marily improved versions of cross-entropy loss. One line of research adapts the cross-entropy loss through techniques such as truncation (Kang & Hashimoto, 2020) and reweight- ing (Ji et al., 2023). Another line of research introduces an additional loss term to complement the cross-entropy loss, such as incorporating reverse cross-entropy (Zhang et al., 2023b), reflective likelihood loss (Dieng et al., 2019), unlikelihood loss (Welleck et al., 2020), and Gaussian prior objective (Li et al., 2020). Stahlberg & Kumar (2022) trans- forms the multi-class word prediction problem into multiple binary classification problems, which also leads to a well- calibrated model distribution when proper scoring rules (e.g., the logarithmic score used in this work) are employed for binary classification. A recent approach (Shao et al., 2023) involves composing the cross-entropy loss with a convex function, which results in a local but improper scoring rule 8Language Generation with Strictly Proper Scoring Rules that alters the shape of the model distribution to be sharper than the data distribution. Other loss functions primarily involve reinforcement learning-based reward optimization, where rewards are derived from evaluation metrics (Ranzato et al., 2016; Shen et al., 2016; Shao et al., 2019; 2021), hu- man feedback (Stiennon et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022), generative adversarial nets (Yu et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2018), or reference demonstrations (Pang & He, 2021). To our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to train lan- guage generation models using scoring rules other than the logarithmic score. 6. Conclusion This paper investigates the use of non-local strictly proper scoring rules for training language generation models, with a primary focus on the Brier score and the spherical score. Although these scores do not perform as well as the logarith- mic score when training models from scratch, they demon- strate substantial improvements when fine-tuning models that have been pre-trained with the logarithmic score. Our findings raise several intriguing questions for future research: Despite being strictly proper, different scores still exhibit considerable performance variations when training language models. Are there other scores that exhibit supe- rior performance during pre-training or fine-tuning? What factors contribute to these performance differences, and can we develop additional metrics or properties to determine a score’s suitability for training language generation models? Furthermore, beyond model training, it is worth exploring whether these scores can function as evaluation metrics, similar to Perplexity (PPL), for assessing the calibration of language generation models. Impact Statement This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of Machine Learning. There are many potential societal consequences of our work, none which we feel must be specifically highlighted here. References Bengio, Y ., Ducharme, R., and Vincent, P.

URL https://acla nthology.org/2023.acl-long.502. 13Language Generation with Strictly Proper Scoring Rules A. α-power Score andα-entmax Loss We are grateful for the very insightful comments provided by Reviewer gaCL, which motivated us to investigate the connection between the α-power score and α-entmax loss. Softmax has a limitation in that it cannot produce probabilities exactly equal to zero. To generate sparse probability distributions, methods such as sparsemax (Martins & Astudillo, 2016) and α-entmax (Peters et al., 2019; Martins et al., 2020) have been proposed, where sparsemax is a special case of α-entmax with α = 2. Given the probability space △d = {p ∈ Rd : p ≥ 0, ∥p∥1 = 1}, α-entmax is a transformation Rd → △d, defined as: α-entmax(z) = arg max p∈△d p⊤z + H⊤ α (p), (23) where H⊤ α (p) is a family of entropies parametrized by a scalar α ≥ 1, known as Tsallis α-entropies: H⊤ α (p) = ( 1 α(α−1) P j (pj − pα j ), α > 1 −P j pj log pj, α = 1. (24) The associated loss function is called α-entmax loss: Lα(z, x) = (p − ex)⊤z + H⊤ α (p), (25) where p = α-entmax(z) and ex is the one-hot vector corresponding to the ground truth word x. We will show that under certain conditions (i.e., the probability of ground truth wordpx > 0, α >1), the α-entmax loss is equivalent to the following token-level loss based on α-power score: Lα-power(p, x) = (α − 1) mX j=1 pα j − αpα−1 x . (26) To solve the constrained problem in equation 23, we can apply the Lagrange multiplier: f(p, λ, µ) =p⊤z + H⊤ α (p) − λ( X j pj − 1) − X j µjpj. (27) ∂f (p, λ, µ) ∂pj = zj − 1 α − 1pα−1 j − λ − µj = 0. (28) Due to the complementary slackness condition of the KKT, if the solution pj > 0, then we have µj = 0, which yields: zj = λ + pα−1 j α − 1. (29) Similarly, if the probability of ground truth word px > 0, then zx = λ + pα−1 x α−1 . Substituting these into equation 25, we obtain: Lα(z, x) = X j,pj>0 pjzj − zx + H⊤ α (p) = X j,pj>0 pj(λ + 1 α − 1pα−1 j ) − λ − pα−1 x α − 1 + H⊤ α (p) = X j pα j α − 1 − pα−1 x α − 1 + 1 α(α − 1) − X j pα j α(α − 1) = 1 α(α − 1)[(α − 1) X j pα j − αpα−1 x + 1] = Lα-power(p, x) + 1 α(α − 1) . (30) As shown, the α-entmax loss is a linear transformation of theα-power score based loss, so they are fundamentally equivalent. This reveals the propriety of the α-entmax loss. However, the equivalence does not hold when px = 0. In this case, zx falls below the threshold of obtaining positive probability, causing the gradient from the probability vector ∂p ∂zx to be 0. This makes it theoretically impossible to obtain a gradient from probability-based loss functions. Therefore, when applying other strictly proper scoring rules to the training of sparse transformations, adjustments are still necessary to ensure that the gradient can be transmitted to the golden logit zx. 14Language Generation with Strictly Proper Scoring Rules B. Scoring Rules as Beam Search Objective We are grateful for the very insightful comments provided by Reviewer z8jq, which inspired us to investigate the application of scoring rules as objectives for beam search. In the realm of conditional generation tasks such as machine translation and text summarization, beam search is a widely adopted decoding strategy aimed at finding the output sequence y with the highest length-normalized log-probability. The formal objective of beam search can be expressed as: max y P|y| t=1 log pθ(yt|x, y<t) |y|α , (31) where α denotes the length penalty hyperparameter. The above equation can also be understood as maximizing the sum of token-level logarithmic scores. Similarly, we can consider having beam search optimize other token-level scoring rules: max y P|y| t=1 S(pθ(·|x, y<t), yt) |y|α . (32) Here, S can be the Brier score S(p, i) = 2pi − Pm j=1 p2 j , the spherical score S(p, i) = pi |p|, or other strictly proper scoring rules. A critical aspect is the sign (positive or negative) of the scoring rule. Given their definitions, the logarithmic score is inherently negative, the spherical score is positive, and the sign of the Brier score is uncertain. For a negative score like the logarithmic score, models tend to favor shorter sentences, whereas the length penalty α can counterbalance this by encouraging longer output. Conversely, for a positive score like the spherical score, models are inclined to generate longer sentences, and here, the length penalty α serves to encourage shorter sentences. To unify them, we subtract 1 from both the Brier score and the spherical score to ensure they are non-positive: S′ Brier = 2pi − mX j=1 p2 j − 1 ≤ 2pi − pi − 1 ≤ 0, S ′ Spherical = pi |p| − 1 ≤ 1 − 1 = 0. (33) We conduct experiments on the WMT14 En-De dataset to evaluate the impact of different scoring rules on the quality of generated text when used as the objective for beam search. The results are presented in Table 11. The results indicate that, among the three scoring rules examined, the logarithmic score yields the best performance, with the Brier score outperforming the spherical score. However, there are exceptions. For instance, the model fine-tuned with the spherical score demonstrated a preference for beam search optimization using the spherical score over the Brier score. Table 11.BLEU scores on WMT14 En-De when applying different scoring rules as beam search objective.

It is plausible that other strictly proper scoring rules could surpass the performance of logarithmic score. We leave this for future exploration. 15",
