# Paper Outline
The core methodology involves an iterative LLM-driven objective discovery pipeline. An LLM (GPT-4) is iteratively prompted to propose and implement new PyTorch-based preference optimization loss functions. The process starts with initial context construction where the LLM is 'burned-in' with established loss functions, their performance, and problem details. Each proposed objective undergoes unit tests for validity. Valid functions are then used to finetune an LLM, and its performance (e.g., MT-Bench scores) is evaluated. This performance metric is fed back to the LLM as in-context examples for iterative refinement, guiding it to synthesize new candidates or variations. DiscoPOP (LRML) itself is mathematically defined as a dynamically weighted sum of logistic and exponential losses, where the weighting factor is determined by a sigmoid function of the β-scaled log ratio difference (ρ), with a temperature parameter τ=0.05.
