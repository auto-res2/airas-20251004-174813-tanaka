    "Open Problems": "DiscoPOP (Log-Ratio Modulated Loss) couples two distinct roles into a single hyper-parameter β: (1) scaling the policy / reference log-ratio (implicitly setting the KL regularisation strength) and (2) controlling the sigmoid that blends the logistic and exponential branches. This coupling makes the loss highly sensitive; extreme β either flattens the blend (training stalls) or explodes gradients (model collapse). A minimal change that separates these two roles could stabilise training and widen the range of usable β values.",
    "Methods": "Decoupled Log-Ratio Modulated Loss (dLRML)\n1. Keep DiscoPOP base idea but introduce two independent scalar hyper-parameters:\n   • β_kl   – multiplies the log-ratio before entering both loss branches (same place β is used today).\n   • β_mix – multiplies the log-ratio only inside the sigmoid that produces the mixing coefficient.\n2. Loss definition (for each preference pair):\n      ρ = (π_chosen − π_rejected) − (ref_chosen − ref_rejected)\n      z = β_kl * ρ                     # controls KL / gradient size\n      m = σ(β_mix * ρ / τ)             # controls branch weighting (τ=0.05 as in DiscoPOP)\n      L = (1-m) * (−log σ(z)) + m * exp(−z)\n3. Motivation:\n   • Decoupling lets one tune exploration (β_mix) without destabilising optimisation (β_kl).\n   • β_mix can be set larger to encourage faster transition to the exponential branch while keeping β_kl small enough to avoid gradient blow-up.\n   • Optional: make β_mix a learnable scalar updated by back-prop; this adds no inference cost.",
    "Experimental Setup": "• Base model: HuggingFace mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct.\n• Dataset: Argilla DPO Mix 7K (same as DiscoPOP) – 6,889 pairwise preferences.\n• Training: 2 epochs, LR=5e-7, batch=2, grad_acc=8, bfloat16, AdamW.\n• Compare three losses:\n   1. DPO (baseline)\n   2. DiscoPOP (β=0.05)\n   3. dLRML (β_kl=0.05, β_mix=0.20)\n• Extra sweep: {β_kl∈[0.01,0.5]} × {β_mix∈[0.05,0.5]} to test stability.\n• Evaluation: MT-Bench score (FastChat) + AlpacaEval 2.0 single-turn chat win-rate.\n• Additional diagnostic: fraction of training steps with NaN/Inf gradients.",
    "Experimental Code": "import torch, torch.nn.functional as F\n\ndef dlrml_loss(policy_chosen_logps,\n               policy_rejected_logps,\n               reference_chosen_logps,\n               reference_rejected_logps,\n               beta_kl=0.05,\n               beta_mix=0.20,\n               tau=0.05):\n    # log-ratio difference ρ\n    rho = (policy_chosen_logps - policy_rejected_logps) - \\\n          (reference_chosen_logps - reference_rejected_logps)\n\n    z = beta_kl * rho                    # affects gradient magnitude / KL strength\n    mix = torch.sigmoid(beta_mix * rho / tau)  # branch weight only\n\n    logistic = -F.logsigmoid(z)\n    exponential = torch.exp(-z)\n\n    loss = (1 - mix) * logistic + mix * exponential\n    return loss\n\n# quick unit test\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    pc, pr, rc, rr = [torch.randn(10, requires_grad=True) for _ in range(4)]\n    l = dlrml_loss(pc, pr, rc, rr).mean()\n    l.backward()\n    print('loss:', l.item())",
    "Expected Result": "1. MT-Bench: dLRML ≈ DiscoPOP +0.5 to +1.0 average points.\n2. Training stability: No NaN runs observed across the β sweep, while DiscoPOP fails for β≥0.25 in >40 % of runs.\n3. AlpacaEval win-rate: dLRML 2-3 % higher than DiscoPOP, 6-8 % higher than DPO.\n4. Gradient norms remain within safe range (checked via logging) even when β_mix is high.",
    "Expected Conclusion": "A simple decoupling of the single β parameter into β_kl and β_mix removes an unnecessary trade-off between optimisation stability and behavioural shaping of the loss. The change is one extra multiplication and retains all advantages of DiscoPOP (adaptive blending of loss branches). Because β_mix can be tuned or learned independently, practitioners gain a wider, more stable hyper-parameter space and immediate performance gains without additional computational cost or architectural changes."
